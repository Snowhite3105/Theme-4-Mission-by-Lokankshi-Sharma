            <h4> Soil is a mixture of organic matter, gases, minerals, liquids, and organisms that together support life such as plants, flowers and a home to insects .</h4>
            <h3> How is it formed?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Soil is formed due to weathering of rocks.Large rocks break into smaller pieces due to rain, wind and temperature.Formation of soil is a slow process. It takes many years to form 1 inch of topsoil on the surface, scientists believe that it takes around millions of years. </p>
            <br>
            <h3> What else makes Soil?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Apart from rocks and minerals there are other natural elements that are used to make the soil are:
                â€¢ Water â€“ Due to rain, water is held between the grains inside the pores.
                â€¢ Air - Pores and cracks in the soil helps to provide air in it.
                â€¢ Nutrients â€“ Wastes of living things and organic matter.
                â€¢ Microorganisms â€“ Organisms that lives on soil, decompose the dead plants and animals into soil</p>
            <br>
            <h3> Soil Erosion </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Soil erosion is a gradual process that occurs because of the impact of the natural elements; Water or Wind as it detaches and removes soil particles, causing the soil to deteriorate. Soil erosion is caused by grazing of animals, agricultural purposes such as pesticides, Mining, Heavy winds etc. Soil erosion is a thread to all forms of life such as, humand and animals but also Mother Earth</p>

            <h1 class="text-capitalize"> Rocks </h1>
            <img src="Rock.jpg">
            <br>
            <h4> A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. </h4>
            <br>
            <img src="Classification%20of%20Rocks.png">
            <br>
            <p> Rocks have both a negative and positive relation to Environment. The negative contribution is: If rocks are buried very deeply, they are in an environment that is very hot and has high pressure. Rocks can affect the atmosphere! The positive relation is:  They contibute in making soil allowing life to survive. </p>
            
            <br>
          <h3> How is it formed</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Rocks are composed primarily of grains of minerals, which are crystalline solids formed from atoms chemical bonded into an orderly structure. Some rocks also contain mineraloids, which are rigid, mineral-like substances, such as volcanic glass, that lacks crystalline structure.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-capitalize"> Pollution </h1>
        <h4> Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light.  </h3>
        <br>
        <h5> Pollution can be divided into 3 categories: Air Pollution, Land Pollution & Noise Pollution </h5>
          <br>
          <h3> How can we stop it?</h3>
          <br> 
<p> 1. Use the 3R's- Reuse your waste, Reduce your waste & Recycle your waste. </p>
<p>2. Use Public transport or Carpool to avoid causing a lot of pollution. </p>
<p> 3. Avoid wasting electricity and water. </p>
<p> 4. Use fans instead of Air Conditioners</p>
<p> 5. Use filter in your chimneys </p>
<p> 6. Use Air Purifiers. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Pollution is a serious threat to life, as it causes diseases leading to death, animals die because of climate change leading to habitat loss etc.

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"> Waste </h1>
               <h4> Waste is a substance which is diposed after primary use as is defective and worthless.  </h3>
              <br>
          <h3> Waste Segregation</h3>
          <br> 
       <p> Waste management also known as Waste Segregation includes the processes and actions which are important for us to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.     
<br>
              <h3> Types of Waste </h3>
              <p> 1. Liquid Waste </p>
<p>2. Soild Rubbish </p>
<p> 3. Organic Waste </p>
<p> 4. Recyclable Waste</p>
<p> 5. Hazardous Waste </p>
